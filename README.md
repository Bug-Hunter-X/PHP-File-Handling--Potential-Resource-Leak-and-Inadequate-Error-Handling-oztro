# PHP File Handling Bug: Resource Leak and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in PHP file handling:  ignoring the return value of `fclose()` and providing insufficient error handling for `fopen()`. Ignoring `fclose()`'s return value can lead to resource leaks, while inadequate error handling makes debugging difficult.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and resource management.

This example highlights the importance of thorough error handling and resource management in PHP to avoid unexpected behavior and maintain application stability.

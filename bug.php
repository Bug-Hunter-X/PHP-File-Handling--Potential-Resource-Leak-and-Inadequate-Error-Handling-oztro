```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle file opening error
}
```
This code has a potential bug: it doesn't explicitly check the return value of `fclose()`. While `fclose()` usually returns `true` on success, it can return `false` if an error occurs during the closing process (e.g., disk full). Ignoring this can lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

Additionally, the error handling for `fopen()` is minimal.  More robust error handling should provide specific information about the cause of the failure (e.g., using `error_get_last()`).
